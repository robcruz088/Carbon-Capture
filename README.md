# Carbon-Capture
 Continutation of Research on Carbon Capture

Initial Stages of a Carbon Capture device.


At the moment, building program to track pollution. Later stages will also track pollution levels, while also using various Machine Learning techniques,
in this case a predictive model so that it can track future levels. It will require a lot of data to fine tune so it won't be added until an acceptable
amount of data has been colletected. 

The Carbon Capture will come even further into the future. This is an individual, independent project that has it roots in the Rutgers University Camden Campus, 
so a lot of features will take some time to develop as I work on this project during my free time.
